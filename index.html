    <h1>Lucas Saudon</h1>
    Well, creating a domain name for checking packages in Dart is like trying to
    find a name for your pet.
    <p>You want it to be cute, but not too corny, you want it to reflect his
      personality, but you don't want it to sound
      weird either.
    </p>
    <p>And if you choose poorly, it can be embarrassing when it comes to
      introducing your pet to your friends.</p>
    <p>
      In this case, your package is your pet, and finding a verified domain name
      is like giving it a name.</p>
    <p>
      Good luck finding a domain name that isn't too cute or too weird, while
      still reflecting your package's
      personality!
